- **Last updated:** 2026-09-08 (UTC) — session **s004: FE-001 done**. First p003 source modification is
  **live**: a login **landing page** + cookie auth replaces the raw Basic prompt when a server password is
  set. Serves at http://192.168.1.249:4447/ (cwd `p003/testing/`, `web` pid 1490948); wrong creds → error
  banner; **Remember-me** → `oc_creds` cookie `Max-Age=1y` (session cookie otherwise), HttpOnly+SaneLax,
  survives iOS *Add to Home Screen*; redirects back to the original path; `/logout` clears. Both UI and
  API gates accept the cookie. Regression: no password set → open server, unchanged. Git: fork
  `nkyang10/opencode` wired (`origin`=fork, `upstream`=original; unshallow before first PR). FU-020 (iOS
  verify + pick permanent password) + FU-019 (rotate PAT) pending. Gotcha recorded: login shell exports `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` → 401 unless started with `env -u`. Repeatable via `p003/scripts/build-linux.sh` + `run-web.sh`. First source modification pending (FU-018).

## Product vision

A web-interface wrapper around **opencode** (`opencode serve`, HTTP REST + SSE on :4096): better UI, better agentic web, **mobile-multitasking first** — run/monitor/intervene in multiple agent sessions from any device.

- Full research: `40-knowledge/agentic-web-ui-research.md`
- Engineering interface opencode exposes: `40-knowledge/opencode-server-api.md`
- Project brief + MVP: `50-projects/p001-opencode-web-ui/README.md`

## Environment status

| Host | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| dev-station | up | this folder lives here; s001 scaffold done |
| dgx-node-01 | up (per gdx) | candidate deployment target; see ../gdx |
| dgx-node-02 | up (per gdx) | candidate deployment target; see ../gdx |

## Recent significant changes

| Date (UTC) | Session | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-07 | s001 | **Project bootstrap** — full control-center structure for `ide` created; research persisted; p001 brief written. |

## s002 addendum (research only, 2026-09-07)
- New p002 direction proposed: **self-testing/thinking/completing multi-agent dev engine** — multiple
  role agents (PM/architect/dev/QA/reviewer) operating through a GitHub repo (issues→PRs), with a
  self-improvement loop. Research persisted → `40-knowledge/multi-agent-sdlc-engine-research.md`.
- No code written. Awaiting FU-007/FU-008 before scaffolding p002.
- Status doc updated by s002; decisions-log unchanged (no irreversible decision taken).

## s002 addendum 2 (operating model — 2026-09-07)
- p002 design now includes the **overnight cycle** (user-verbatim): hand-off → interview till "good" →
  confirmed kickoff → multi-agent GitHub run (board, self-raised issues, idle researcher) → morning
  report → loop on same repo until "requirement reached". Added FE-002 + `researcher` role; DEC-006.
- Build still not started; FU-007 (go-ahead to build) now concretely means: implement FE-001+FE-002 on a
  scratch repo.

## s002 addendum 3 (engine built — 2026-09-07)
- **p002 engine MVP implemented + dry-run validated**: `scripts/driver.py` (#handoff/clarify/run/report/cycle),
  stdlib `github_api.py`, role prompts (assembler/engineer/qa/reviewer/researcher/retro), config/engine.json,
  `--dry-run` passes end-to-end. DEC-007. Runbook rb-002 added.
- **GitHub live**: new repos `nkyang10/selfide` (main, pushed) = home of the ide control center;
  `nkyang10/cloud-pos-system` = playground for engine test runs. Token scoped admin on both.
- **Engine scope note (user)**: engine is generic — prompt it with ANY project; cloud-pos-system is only
  a test playground.
- Next: live engine run on the playground (needs user go + model config).

## s002 addendum 4 (permissions verified — 2026-09-07)
- Engine's GitHub exchange layer **live-verified all green** on the playground: issues, board comments,
  branch pushes, PR create/later merge, branch delete. Probe = `driver.py probe` (auto self-cleaning).
- Playground repaired along the way: default branch = `main` (clean README), old probe issues/branches removed.
- Git layer got retries (intermittent github.com:443 drops observed; REST unaffected).
- Next: real night-cycle run (FU-012). Token rotation still pending after use (FU-013).
